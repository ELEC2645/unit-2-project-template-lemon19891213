Core Functionality
This scientific calculator, implemented in C for command-line interaction, focuses on four core functionalities for scientific computing scenarios, combining robustness with ease of use:
Basic arithmetic operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integer modulo operations, and exponentiation. Built-in boundary checks for division by zero and invalid exponentiation (e.g., negative numbers raised to non-integer powers) prevent programme exceptions;
Trigonometric Functions: Covers sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan) operations. Supports dual-unit angle input (degrees/radians) with automatic conversion between degrees and radians. Handles undefined scenarios such as singularities in the tangent function (π/2 + kπ).
Logarithmic operations: Includes natural logarithm (ln), common logarithm (log₁₀), and logarithms with custom bases (implemented via base conversion formulas), with strict domain validation for arguments (x > 0) and bases (> 0 and ≠ 1).
Unit Conversion: Focuses on three high-frequency dimensions—length (metres/centimetres/inches/feet), temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit/Kelvin), and mass (kilograms/grams/pounds)—employing the ‘intermediate units method’ to simplify logic while ensuring conversion accuracy;
Interaction safeguards: Full-path input validation (integer/floating-point formats, numerical domains), unified ‘menu selection - function execution - input b/B to return to main menu’ workflow, clear error prompts, and zero risk of programme crashes.
